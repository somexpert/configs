TODO: fill this out more

This repository exists to help me do 3 things:
1. Track changes to my configuration files that I think will be useful across machines.
2. Set up a new "home" computer with minimal effort in a way that continues to let me track changes in this repository.
3. Set up an `ssh` configuration on a "home" machine in such a way that allows me to, from that home machine, automatically transfer and source configuration files onto remote machines without having to do anything on those remotes beforehand.
